Hi! My name is Yuan Yao, or 姚<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_(surname)">1</a>]</sup>远<sup>[<a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E8%BF%9C">2</a>]</sup> in Chinese.

[My UU page is here.](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N19-1721)

## Professional Background
I am currently an **Assistant Professor** at the **Uppsala Computer Architecture Research Team (UART), Uppsala University, Sweden**.

I was a Postdoc researcher at Uppsala University 2019-2020. Before joining Uppsala University, I earned my **PhD in Electronic and Computer Systems (2019)** and an **M.S. in System-on-Chip Design (2014)**, both from **KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden**.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on:
- **Network-on-Chip (NoC) design**
- **Heterogeneous architectures**
- **Energy-efficient accelerators for emerging workloads (AI and big graphs)**
- **Energy-efficient multi-core**

## Open Source & Personal Projects
Beyond academia, I have my hobbies in **open-source projects**, particularly in:
- **[gem5](https://www.gem5.org/)** (computer architecture simulation)
- **Linux kernel** (low-level systems development. And yes, I hate bisects)

I also work on **private projects for fun**, typically during the summer break. Some of these can be found in the **Tools** section.

## Besides programming languages
Myself speaks:
- **Chinese** (Native)
- **English** (Fluent)
- **Swedish** (Basic communication)
