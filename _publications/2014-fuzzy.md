Flow regulation is a traffic shaping technique, which can be used to improve communication performance with better utilization of network resources in chip multi-processors (CMPs). This paper presents fuzzy flow regulation. Being different from the static flow regulation policy, our system makes regulation decisions fully dynamically according to traffic dynamism and the state of interconnection network. The central idea is to use fuzzy logic to mimic the behavior of an expert that can recognize the network status and then intelligently control the admission of input flows. As the experiment results show, the maximum improvement in average delay reaches 53.0% against static regulation and 37.4% against no regulation. The maximum improvement in average throughput reaches 37.5% against static regulation and 23.8% against no regulation.
