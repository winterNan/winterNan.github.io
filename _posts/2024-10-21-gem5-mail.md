Hello,
In function checkSignalsAndUpdate(ThreadID tid) in src/cpu/o3/fetch.cc file, it 
seems miss prediction can still happen from commit and decode even if 
mispredictInst->isControl() is false.

```cpp
// Check squash signals from commit.
if (fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].squash) {
    DPRINTF(Fetch, "[tid:%i] Squashing instructions due to squash "
            "from commit.\n",tid);
    // In any case, squash.
    squash(*fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].pc,
           fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].doneSeqNum,
           fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].squashInst, tid);
    // If it was a branch mispredict on a control instruction, update the
    // branch predictor with that instruction, otherwise just kill the
    // invalid state we generated in after sequence number
    if (fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].mispredictInst &&
        fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].mispredictInst->isControl()) {
        branchPred->squash(fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].doneSeqNum,
                *fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].pc,
                fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].branchTaken, tid);
    } **else {
        branchPred->squash(fromCommit->commitInfo[tid].doneSeqNum,
                           tid);
    }**
    return true;
} 
```

Can someone please explain when would this else condition be true? How can 
there be miss prediction of non-control instructions?

My answer
======
Yes, because not all the squashes are caused by control instructions.

Another source of squash is memory violations
(IEW::SquanshDueToMemOrder).

There, the squash bit toCommit->squash is set, but
toCommit->mispredictInst is set to NULL.

Thus, when the reason for the squash is later checked in Commit::commit() and 
then in
Fetch::checkSignalsAndUpdate, the if(fromIEW->mispredictInst[tid]) branch is 
not executed.

The branchPred->squash() function in the else-part is to delete all the branch
predictor states that has been made after the squash instruction
(BPredUnit::Squash).

Hope this helps.
