Hi, I am working on the x86 page walker in gem5. I understand that the page
walker accesses the page walker cache (PWC) first and, in case of a miss,
it accesses the memory hierarchy (L1, then L2, then L3 caches and lastly
the memory). This happens through the packetpointer *read*, which reads the
physical address of the entry at each level (PML4, PDP.. etc.).


Now, what I would like to inquire about is how to identify where this read
request for the PTE hits in the memory hierarchy. In other words, for each
step, I would like to know whether this entry was a hit in L1, L2, or L3.
So, is there any field or function/method in the packet that holds this
information? If not, how can I get this information?

Thanks,

Hi,

I have done something similar with ruby enabled. Hope this helps.

Basically you need to set your own message flags in the pagetable walker
and checks that flag in the SLICC code when a cacheline hits.
Below is an example of how to do it in the L1 and L2.

in request.hh

```cpp
bool isYourType() const {return _flags.isSet(your_flag);}
```

in pagetable_walker.cc

```cpp
setupWalk(Addr vaddr){

    Request::Flags flags = Request::PHYSICAL;
    flags.set(Request::your_flag);
    ...
}
```

in RubyRequest.hh

```cpp
book checkYourType() const { return m_pkt->req->isYourType();}
```

in PROTOCOL-L1Cache.sm

```cpp
in_port(mandatoryQueue_in, RubyRequest ...)
    if (mandatorQueue_in.isReady(clockEdge()))
        peek(mandatoryQueue_in ...)

            if(is_valid(L1Dcache_entry))
                if(in_msg.checkYourType() == true)
                    # you have it in your local private cache
                else
                    # forward the request to L2
```

in PROTOCOL-L2Cache.sm

```cpp
in_port(L1RequestL2Network_in, ...)
    if(L1RequestL2Network_in.isReady(clockEdge()))
        peek(L1RequestL2Network_in ...)
            if(is_valid(cache_entry))
                if(in_msg.checkYourType() == true)
                    # you have it in your shared L2
                else
                    # forward to where it should be

```
