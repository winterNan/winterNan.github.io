**TL;DR** Introduction to Computer Architecture  
*I have been the course responsible since 2021*

# Introduction to Computer Architecture  

## Course Overview  
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles of computer architecture, focusing on the design, operation, and performance of modern computer systems. Using the MIPS architecture as a foundation, students will explore how computers execute programs at the lowest level, how hardware components interact, and how performance can be optimized through various architectural techniques.

## Course Content  
The course covers the following key topics:  

- **Understanding the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**  
  - Assembly instructions and how they map to hardware execution  
- **Logic-level components**  
  - Logic design, processor datapath, and control logic  
- **Instruction-level components**  
  - Pipelining, hazards, branch prediction, caches, and parallelism  
- **System-level components**  
  - Virtual memory, input/output mechanisms  

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this course, students will be able to:  

- Understand the core components of a computer system, including the processor, memory, and input/output devices.  
- Analyze and reason about first-order performance metrics.  
- Understand the hardware/software interface and its role in system design.  
- Write and debug assembly language programs.  

## Teaching Methodology: Flipped Classroom  
This course adopts a **flipped classroom** approach:  

- Students watch video lectures at home to learn theoretical concepts.  
- Classroom sessions focus on problem-solving exercises, discussions, and hands-on activities.  

### Benefits of the Flipped Classroom  
- Encourages active learning and student engagement.  
- Provides more opportunities for collaborative problem-solving.  
- Enhances conceptual understanding through guided practice.  

## Prerequisites  
- Basic understanding of digital logic and programming is recommended.  

## Assessment  
- Homework assignments and quizzes  
- Programming tasks in assembly language  
- Final exam assessing theoretical and practical understanding
